# Suppler: Skin Condition Classifier

Welcome to Suppler, a user-friendly interface designed to make skin condition diagnosis more accessible and straightforward using the power of machine learning. This application utilizes a MobileNet-V2model that classifies common skin conditions, offering insights to users who might be seeking an initial understanding of their symptoms. It serves as a screening tool but does not replace the role that dermatologists play in skin health.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you're familiar with it, you'll be right at home. If not, follow the instructions below to get started!

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If not, download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd suppler
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application. As you make changes to the code, the page will automatically reload to reflect them.

### `npm test`

This command initiates the test runner in an interactive watch mode. For more details, refer to [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This script is used to prepare the app for production. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Once the build process is complete, you'll have a `build` folder with all the necessary files to deploy the app.

### `npm run eject`

While this is an advanced operation and often not necessary, if you need more control over the build tools and configurations, you can eject from the default setup. Remember, it's a one-way operation; once you eject, there's no turning back!

## Using the Application

1. Open the application.
2. Upload or take a picture of the skin condition you want to diagnose.
3. Wait for the model to process the image.
4. Review the results provided by the machine learning model.

## Important Links

- Learn more about how this project was set up in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
- If you're new to React, dive into the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
